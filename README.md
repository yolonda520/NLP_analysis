# Speech to Text with NLP Analysis project
## Goal:
1. Develop a custom business case in class that will include semi-structured text data. Then present the business insight based on the quantitative frameworks. 
2. We assume a travel business company that sell the Alcatraz Island tickets, so we record 30 cusotmers answers and transfer to .txt to prepare NLP analysis.
3. Develop a Shiny app that will include at least 3 frameworks and describe insights.
